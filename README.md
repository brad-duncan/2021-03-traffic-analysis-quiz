# 2021-03-traffic-analysis-quiz

This is a github repository for a March 2021 traffic analysis quiz, located here: https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/March+2021+Traffic+Analysis+Quiz/27228/

Password for either of the two zip archives from this repository is: infected

Of note, the file labled as "malware and artifacts" contains actual Windows-based malware.  I reccomend you don't open the malware and artifacts zip archive on a Windows host, because there is a risk of infection.
